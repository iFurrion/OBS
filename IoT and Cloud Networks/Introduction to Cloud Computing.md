## What is the cloud?
The US national institute of Standards and Technology defines it as a way of using information technology that has 5 equally important traits:
- On-Demand Self-Service: Can be used whenever it is needed
- Broad Network Access: The resources can be accessed from anywhere
- Resource Pooling: Cloud provider allocates resources to every user from a shared pool
- Rapid Elasticity: Needs to be able to scale up or down as needed
- Measured Service: The user pays only the amount they reserve
They are not a physical place but a network of servers and they are designed for daily use.

## Key Advantages:
- Scalability
- Cost - Efficiency
- Flexibility & Reliability
- Security & Privacy

## 4 Different Models:
- Public Cloud: Services shared by many customers
- Private Cloud: Dedicated Structure for a single organization
- Hybrid Cloud: A mix of Private and Public cloud
- Multi Cloud: A mix of two or more public cloud providers

## Cloud Service Models:
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Renting basic IT infrastructure: (servers, storage)
- PaaS (Platform as a Service): Providing platforms for app development and deployment
- SaaS (Software as a Service): Ready to use applications delivered over the internet (email, collaboration tools)

## Common Terms:
- Cloud: A flexible IT model that provides digital storage  and workspaces on a global network of servers. It  allows you to access data like documents, photos,  and software from any device, anywhere.
- Cloud Provider: Platforms such as GCP, Azure, AWS  designed by companies that provide  cloud services.
- Cloud Computing: Using the internet to access IT resources like  storage, processing power, or software instead of  using your own devices.
- Data Center: A building or room filled with many  servers, where cloud providers  operate their IT infrastructure.
- Server: Powerful computer that store and provide  services and data in the cloud, allowing users to  access these resources flexibly and on demand. 
- Edge Computing: Edge computing processes data  where it's created, like on-site  devices or at the network's edge.  This saves bandwidth, reduces  network congestion, and allows for  real-time data analysis, which is  crucial for applications requiring fast  responses. 
- Cloud Infrastructure: The servers, networks, and storage—all the  hardware and software—needed to manage cloud  services.
