## Requirements for the Presentation
The core assignment is to present a complete  end-to-end solution for an IoT problem, using the  concepts and tools taught in the course: 
- Topic: Design, Implement, and Present a  Cloud-Enabled IoT Solution  
- Duration: 15 minutes presentation + 5  minutes Q&A. 
- Group Size: Individual or Small Group up to  3 people
### Definition of a Problem:
- Clearly define the real-world  problem the solution addresses (e.g., smart waste  management, predictive maintenance, energy  monitoring, etc.) 
- Justify why a solution is needed for this problem
- Present a High level diagram for the solution
### Economics and Risk Management:
- Analyze the pay-per-use model for the utilized cloud services
- Identify one key security/privacy risk for the solution and how it was mitigated
- Briefly explain the  steps taken to recognize, formulate, and solve a  specific technical challenge during the  implementation

### The Future:
- Summarize and recap how the solution solves the initial problem
- Suggest a practical next  step or optimization

### Time Management:
Depends on group size, check [[00 - Final Exam Presentation.pdf|the exam presentation]]

### Recommendations
- The Goal is a Working Solution: The project  must demonstrate a clear, end-to-end operational  flow from your IoT device to the application layer 
- Simplify the Architecture: Choose the simplest  architecture that effectively solves your problem.  Avoid adding unnecessary cloud services solely for  the sake of complexity or "ticking boxes." 
- Quality of execution is more important than the  quantity of services used 
- Have an eye on your cloud budget: GCP  provides only 300 EUR free credits 

### Non-Cloud Solutions:
- Broker Tools: EMQX, VerneMQ, Mosquitto
- Data Warehouse Tools: InfluxDB, and Telegraf for data transmission
- Hosting: You can spawn a Compute Engine (VM)  in the cloud and host cloud-native tools natively or  inside containers via Docker/Docker-Compose.

### IoT Devices:
-  IoT/MQTT Simulator: Simulator for publishing  JSON objects to a broker, simulating sensors and  devices (no physical device needed) 
- Zigbee Gateway Device: USB Dongle to collect data from devices 
- Zigbee IoT Devices: Different types of sensors, like temperature or humidity

## Tips for IoT:
- Build first, then optimize
- Start with fundamentals, specialize later
- Try to stay in the free tier and build small projects
